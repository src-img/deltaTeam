  <h2>ðŸ¤« What is a Rest?</h2>
  <p>
    While notes tell you when to <em>play</em>, <strong>rests</strong> tell you
    when to <em>stay silent</em>. A rest is a symbol for a pause in the music.
    Just like notes, rests have different lengths. Some are short (like a quick
    breath), while others are long (like a full pause).
  </p>
  <p>
    Learning to read rests is just as important as learning notesâ€”silence is
    part of the rhythm too!
