  <h2>👀 Reading Sheet Music</h2>
  <p>
    Reading sheet music is like reading a map for music. Here's what to look
    for:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Clef</strong> – Most common is the
      <strong>treble clef</strong> (𝄞), which tells you how to read the notes on
      the staff.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Notes & Rests</strong> – Tell you what to play and when to be
      silent.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bar Lines</strong> – Vertical lines that break the music into
      small groups of beats, called <strong>measures</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Key Signature</strong> – Shows which notes are sharp (#) or flat
      (♭) throughout the piece.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Think of sheet music as instructions for what to play, when to play, and how
    long to play each sound or silence.
