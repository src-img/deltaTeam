  <h2>ðŸ•’ What is a Time Signature?</h2>
  <p>
    A <strong>time signature</strong> is found at the beginning of a piece of
    music and looks like a fraction, like <strong>4/4</strong> or
    <strong>3/4</strong>. It tells you two things:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Top number</strong> â€“ How many beats are in each measure (section
      of music).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bottom number</strong> â€“ What kind of note gets one beat (4 =
      quarter note, 8 = eighth note, etc.).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>4/4</strong> time means 4 quarter-note beats per measure (this is
      the most common and is sometimes called "common time").
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>3/4</strong> time means 3 quarter-note beats per measure (like a
      waltz).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The time signature helps you understand the <em>rhythm</em> of the
    musicâ€”itâ€™s the heartbeat of the song.
